Few things are more annoying than stuff which does not work as announced,
especially when you find out only after an invest of time and energy.

Documentation is often prone to produce such situations, since hard to keep
100% in sync with the code evolution.

<!-- autogen tutorial -->


This is a set of tools, *generating* documentation, while verifying the documented
claims about code behaviour - without the need to adapt the source code, e.g. by modifying
doc strings:

additional benefit of writing it like shown is the availability of [source

        # Link Replacements

        Technical markdown content wants to link to source code often.
        How to get those links working and that convenient?

        The module does offer also some source finding / link replacement feature,
        via the [mdtool]<SRC> module. The latter link was built simply by this:

        ```
        [mdtool]<SRC>
        ```


        Other example: This [pytest2md]<SRC> link was created by replacing "SRC" with the path
        to a file matching, under a given directory, prefixed by an arbitrary base URL.

        ## Spec

        These will be replaced:

        `[title:this,fmatch:test_tutorial,lmatch:line_match] <SRC>` (remove space between] and <)

        - title: The link title - text the user reads
        - fmatch: substring match for the link destination file
        - lmatch: Find matching line within that file
        - show_raw: Link to raw version of file, not the one rendered by the
          repo server
        - path: Fix file path (usually derived by fmach)
        - line: Fix the line number of the link (usually done via lmatch)

        ## Code Repo Hoster Specific Source Links

        Github, Gitlab, Bitbucked or Plain directory based static content servers
        all have their conventional URLs regarding those links.

        Since all of these are just serving static content w/o js possibilities,
        you have to parametrize the intended hoster in your environment, before
        running a pytest / push cycle. That way the links will be working on the hoster.

        Currently we understand the following namespaces for links:


        ```javascript
        _link_names_
        ```

        ### Setting a link template

        - `export MD_LINKS_FOR=github   ` # before running pytest / push
        - `<!-- md_links_for: github -->` # in the markdown template, static

        The latter can be overwritten by environ, should you want to push from time to time
        to a different code hoster.

        ### Link Refs

        We minimize the problem of varying generated target markdown, dependent on the hoster.
        How? Like [any problem in IT is solved](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_theorem_of_software_engineering).


        By building [reference links](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet#links)
        the differences of e.g. a README.md for github vs. gitlab is
        restricted to the links section on the end of the generated markdown.
        In the markdown bodies you'll just see link names, which remain the same.

        > Check the end of the [title:rendering result,fmatch:README.md,show_raw:True]<SRC> at the end of this README.md,
        in order to see the results for the hoster you are reading this markdown file currently.

        ## Summary

        - At normal runs of pytest, the link base URL is just a local `file://` link,

        - Before pushes one can set via environ (e.g. `export
          MD_LINKS_FOR=github`)  these e.g. to the github base URL or the repo.

        - `[key-values]` constructs are supported as well, extending to beyond
          just the base url. Example following:

        """.replace(
            '_link_names_',
            json.dumps(p2m.src_link_templates, indent=4, sort_keys=2),
        )
        p2m.md(md)

    def test_sh_code(self):
        p2m.md('Source code showing is done like this:')
        p2m.sh_code(self.test_sh_code)
        p2m.md(
            '> Is [title:this,fmatch:test_tutorial,lmatch:exotic]<SRC> an exotic form of a recursion? ;-)  '
        )

    def test_write(self):
        """has to be the last 'test'"""
        # default is ../README.md
        p2m.write_markdown(with_source_ref=True, make_toc=True)
```


Lets run a bash command and assert on its results.
Note that the command is shown in the readme, incl. result and the result
can be asserted upon.
```bash
$ cat "/etc/hosts" | grep localhost
127.0.0.1   localhost localhost.localdomain localhost4 localhost4.localdomain4
